    <P><SPAn>Antimicrobial resistance</SPAn> is a growing problem that occurs when microbes, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, become resistant to the drugs used to treat them. This means that the drugs become less effective against the infection, making them harder to treat. Antimicrobial resistance can happen for several reasons, including:<br>

        • Overuse or misuse of antibiotics: When antibiotics are overused or not taken properly, microbes can develop resistance to the drugs.<br>
        • Lack of new antibiotics: The development of new antibiotics has slowed down in recent years, which means that there are fewer options available to treat infections..</P>
        <p>Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microbes develop genetic changes that allow them to survive and multiply in the presence of the drug that would normally kill them. The microbes can then pass these genetic changes on to their offspring, making them resistant to the drug as well.

            This can happen in several ways; <br>
            
            • Genetic mutations: Random changes in the genetic code of the microbe can make it resistant to the drug.<br>
            • Horizontal gene transfer: Microbes can exchange genes with each other, which allows them to share resistance genes.</p>
