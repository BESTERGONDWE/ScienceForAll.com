    <P> 1. Limited Treatment Options;  Microbial resistance can lead to limited treatment options for infections, as antimicrobial-resistant infections may require the use of second- and third-line treatments, which can be less effective and cause serious side effects .<br><br>
        2. Increased Morbidity and Mortality: Drug-resistant infections can result in increased morbidity and mortality, as they can be harder to treat and may lead to more severe illness or complications. <br><br>
        3. Harmful Side Effects: The use of second- and third-line treatments for antimicrobial-resistant infections can harm patients by causing serious side effects.<br><br>
        4. Public Health Impact: Antimicrobial resistance can have a significant public health impact, as it may lead to the spread of drug-resistant strains of bacteria, making it more challenging to control and treat infections.<br><br>
        5. Overuse of Antibiotics: Overuse of antibiotics can promote antibiotic resistance, leading to the development of resistant germs and causing needless and harmful side effects.<br><br>
        
        These effects highlight the importance of addressing antimicrobial resistance to ensure effective treatment options and minimize the public health impact of drug-resistant infections.
